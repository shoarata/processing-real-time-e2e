## üîß Project Title: Real-Time Analytics Platform for E-Commerce Events

### üß© Overview
You‚Äôll build an end-to-end data platform that captures user events from an e-commerce app in real time, processes them, stores them in different data lake/table formats, transforms them, and serves them for analytics and reporting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è High-Level Architecture
```
[Event Generator] --> [Kafka] --> [Flink/Beam] --> [Iceberg/Delta Lake on S3/GCS/ADLS]

                                   [Snowflake/Databricks]
                                         ‚Üì
                                      [DBT Models]
                                         ‚Üì
                                   [Airflow Orchestration]

                                [Jenkins + Terraform + K8s]
                               
```
### üì¶ Components and How Each Tool Fits

| Tool             | Role                                                                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apache Flink     | Stream processing of Kafka events (e.g., clickstream, purchases).                     |
| Apache Beam      | Alternative stream + batch processing pipeline, running on Flink or Spark runner.     |
| Apache Airflow   | Orchestration of workflows (e.g., DBT jobs, data quality checks, loading into Snowflake). |
| Snowflake        | Cloud data warehouse for serving BI/reporting workloads.                              |
| Databricks       | For ad-hoc analysis, machine learning, and ETL on Delta Lake.                         |
| Apache Iceberg   | Used as a format for large-scale storage on cloud (S3/GCS), allows time travel.       |
| DBT              | Transformation layer on Snowflake or Databricks using SQL models.                     |
| Jenkins          | CI/CD for your infrastructure and data pipeline code.                                 |
| Kubernetes       | Host Flink/Beam jobs, Airflow, DBT, Jenkins on a local or cloud K8s cluster.          |
| Terraform        | Provision cloud infra: Snowflake, Databricks, K8s cluster, storage, etc.              |
| Apache Spark     | Used via Databricks or standalone for batch processing.                               |
| Delta Lake       | Storage layer format for Databricks ETL (can use with Spark).                         |

### üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Build Plan

1. Event Generation
    * Write a Python script to generate fake e-commerce events (user signups, product views, purchases).
Push events to Kafka.
2. Stream Processing
    * Build a Flink job to consume Kafka events, enrich them (e.g., geo-IP resolution), and write to Iceberg tables on S3/GCS/MinIO.
    * Bonus: Build an alternative Beam pipeline (running on Flink or Spark runner) for the same job.
3. Batch ETL with Spark + Delta
    * Run Spark jobs in Databricks to process raw data and create clean, partitioned Delta Lake tables.
4. Modeling with DBT
    * Use DBT to build models in Snowflake (or Databricks SQL warehouse) for analytics (e.g., daily revenue, active users).
5. Orchestration with Airflow
    * Set up Airflow on Kubernetes to run:
        * DBT transformations
        * Data quality checks
        * Loading snapshots from Iceberg to Snowflake
6. CI/CD with Jenkins
    * Use Jenkins pipelines to:
        * Test DBT models
        * Deploy Flink/Beam jobs
        * Trigger Terraform
7. Infrastructure as Code
    * Use Terraform to:
        * Provision Snowflake roles/warehouses
        * Set up Databricks workspaces and clusters
        * Deploy Flink cluster, Airflow, Jenkins on Kubernetes
        * 
### üìä Stretch Goals / Bonus Ideas

* Add real-time dashboards (Grafana on top of Prometheus metrics).
* Implement time travel or rollback using Iceberg and Delta features.
* Set up row/column-level security in Snowflake.
* Add unit/integration tests for pipelines.
